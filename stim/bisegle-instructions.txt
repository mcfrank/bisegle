Welcome!  In this experiment you're going to be listening to sentences in
a made-up language.  Your job is to learn the words of this language. For
the first part of the experiment you will hear a bunch of sentences and 
then in the second part we will test you on how much you learned.  The 
whole experiment should take about 10 minutes. Please listen carefully. 

If you don't hear any sound after you press a key, go get an 
experimenter.  Once you're done listening to the sounds, more 
instructions will come up. Press any key to begin.
