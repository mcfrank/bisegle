Now it's time for the test.  On the screen, you will see a written representation of a
string in the language you just heard. Your job is to click between syllables to 
indicate where the words begin and end.  For example, if you had a string like "I am an elephant"
you would see:

i   am   an   el   e   phant

and your job would be to click so that it looked like:

i | am | an | el   e   phant

To make your job easier, you can listen to the string as many times as you want. 
If you think that there is a break between two syllables (e.g., one is part of one 
word and the other is part of a different word) just click between them and a line
will appear between them.  If you change your mind, you can click again and the 
line will disappear.

Press any key to go on.
