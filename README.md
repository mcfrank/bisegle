Code and data for Frank et al. (2010), CogSci Proceedings, paper available at [http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers/FTAG-cogsci2010.pdf](). 

Matlab code is for running the experiment, this depended on MBROLA, a speech synth that is now somewhat defunct. 

R code for analysis is in the `analysis` directory. 

All of this is from a time relatively early in my journey into reproducibility, please be kind.
